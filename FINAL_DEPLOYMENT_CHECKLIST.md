### For Michael (You):

🌉 Announcing The Bridge Project - A Constitutional Defense Fund

I'm using AI to reform criminal justice. JAHmere Webb has been
incarcerated 12 years for a crime committed with the mental
capacity of a 15-year-old. 

Oct 20: Judge Ferrero decides: 12 MORE years or treatment
(176% more effective).

We're raising $50K for constitutional defense that could set
precedent for thousands.

Co-Founders:
• JAHmere Webb (The Heart)
• Jordan Dungy (The Voice) - Tony Dungy's son
• Michael Mataluni (The Mind)

Join us: [YOUR LIVE URL]

#CriminalJusticeReform #ConstitutionalLaw #TheBridgeProject
```

### For Jordan Dungy:
**Instagram/Twitter:**
```
🌉 My best friend JAHmere has been in the system since we were
kids. Mental capacity of 15. 12 years served. Oct 20: Judge
decides 12 MORE years or treatment.

We're raising $50K for constitutional lawyers to argue 8th & 14th
Amendment violations.

If we win: precedent for THOUSANDS of families.

My dad @TonyDungy believes in JAHmere. I believe in JAHmere.

## 💎 GUARDIAN JOHN'S COMPLETION STANDARD

Building ≠ Deploying ≠ Activating ≠ Running

**You're not done until:**
- ✅ Website is LIVE (not just built)
- ✅ Lawyers have been EMAILED (not just have templates)
- ✅ Social media is POSTED (not just drafted)
- ✅ Donations can be RECEIVED (not just linked)
- ✅ You've TESTED everything (not just assumed)

**Would Grandpa John be proud?**

Ask yourself: Is this FINISHED or just "done"?
