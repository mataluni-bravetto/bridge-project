Dear Judge Ferrero:

I am writing to provide a character reference for Jahmere, whom I have had the privilege of knowing and working with over recent months. I am Michael Mataluni, Founder and CEO of AbÃ«ONE Research Laboratory, and I am writing to share what I have personally witnessed regarding Jahmere's character, growth, and transformation.

## How I Know Jahmere

I met Jahmere through his mother, Martha, who reached out to me seeking guidance and support during one of the most challenging periods of their lives. What began as an introduction has evolved into a relationship built on mutual respect, shared purpose, and genuine care.

## What I Have Witnessed

In my interactions with Jahmere, I have observed several remarkable qualities that speak to his character and potential:

### **1. Intellectual Curiosity and Growth Mindset**

Jahmere demonstrates a genuine hunger for knowledge and self-improvement. When I introduced him to artificial intelligence tools and technologies, he didn't just passively receive the informationâ€”he actively engaged, asked thoughtful questions, and immediately began exploring how these tools could help not just himself, but his family and community.

I have watched Jahmere learn to use AI for research, writing, and problem-solving. This wasn't about shortcuts or easy answers. It was about a young man who, despite his circumstances, was determined to expand his capabilities and his understanding of the world.

### **2. Deep Love and Commitment to Family**

What strikes me most about Jahmere is the depth of his love for his mother, Martha. In every conversation, his concern for her well-being, his awareness of her sacrifices, and his determination to make her proud are evident. This is not superficial sentimentâ€”this is profound family devotion.

Jahmere understands what his mother has endured on his behalf. He carries that knowledge with a sense of responsibility, not entitlement. He speaks of wanting to give back, to help others, to ensure that his mother's faith in him is vindicated.

### **3. Authentic Desire to Help Others**

Through our conversations, it became clear that Jahmere's vision extends beyond his own circumstances. He has spoken passionately about wanting to help other young people who face similar challenges, who feel trapped by their pasts, who need someone to believe in them.

This desire to serve others, even while facing his own significant challenges, reveals something essential about Jahmere's character: he has not allowed his struggles to make him self-absorbed or bitter. Instead, he has allowed them to create empathy and a genuine desire to be part of the solution for others.

### **4. Willingness to Learn and Change**

I have worked with many people in my careerâ€”entrepreneurs, researchers, students, professionals. One thing I've learned is that the most successful people are not those who never make mistakes, but those who demonstrate a genuine capacity for learning and growth.

Jahmere has shown me this capacity. He listens. He reflects. He applies what he learns. He asks for guidance and then takes action on it. These are the qualities of someone who is not making excuses but is genuinely committed to transformation.

### **5. Faith and Resilience**

Despite everything Jahmere has facedâ€”tragedies that "never should have occurred," as his mother describesâ€”he maintains a joyful spirit and a belief in better possibilities. This kind of resilience in the face of adversity speaks to inner strength and faith that cannot be fabricated.

## The Bridge Project: Evidence of Purpose

Most significantly, Jahmere's experiencesâ€”both his struggles and his growthâ€”have become the foundation for something larger: **The Bridge Project**. This initiative, spearheaded by his mother Martha with Jahmere's full support and involvement, aims to help other families affected by the criminal justice system.

Jahmere's story, his pain, his trials, and his tribulations are not wasted. They are being transformed into purpose. They are becoming a bridge for others who feel hopeless, lost, or forgotten. This is not theoreticalâ€”this is happening now. Jahmere is part of something that will help countless families navigate the very challenges he has faced.

## My Commitment to Jahmere's Continued Growth

I am writing this letter not out of obligation, but out of genuine belief in Jahmere's potential and my commitment to supporting his continued transformation. I am prepared to:

- Continue mentoring Jahmere in the use of technology and AI tools for positive impact
- Support his involvement in The Bridge Project as it helps other families
- Provide professional guidance and opportunities as Jahmere builds his future
- Serve as a consistent source of support and accountability

I don't offer this lightly. I am a busy person with significant professional responsibilities. I choose to invest in Jahmere because I believe he is worth that investment. I believe he has something valuable to offer the world. I believe his story is not overâ€”in fact, the most important chapters are yet to be written.

## What I Ask of the Court

Your Honor, I respectfully ask that you consider not just what Jahmere has done in the past, but who he is becoming and who he has the potential to be. I ask that you see what I have seen: a young man who, despite facing circumstances that would break many people, still has joy, still has faith, still has love for his family, and still has a desire to help others.

I ask that you consider the impact of your decision not just on Jahmere, but on his mother Martha, who has fought tirelessly for her son; on The Bridge Project, which will help countless other families; and on all the young people Jahmere will mentor and inspire in the years to come.

Jahmere has a strong support system. He has a mother who will never give up on him. He has a community that believes in him. He has mentors like myself who are committed to his success. He has a purpose that extends beyond himself.

## In Closing

Judge Ferrero, I look forward to being a witness to Jahmere's continued growth and transformation. I have seen the beginning of this journey, and I am confident that given the opportunity, Jahmere will prove that faith in him is justified.

I believe in second chances not because I am naive about human nature, but because I have seen what happens when people are given the support, tools, and opportunity to become who they are meant to be. Jahmere is on that path. I ask that you allow him to continue walking it.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss my observations further, I am available at your convenience.

**Respectfully submitted,**
