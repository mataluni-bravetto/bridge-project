## 📱 **SOCIAL MEDIA LAUNCH POST**

**For Martha to post when website goes live**:

```
🌉 LAUNCHING TODAY: The Bridge Project

I'm Martha, Jahmere's mama. When my son faced impossible odds 
in the criminal justice system, I learned to fight using AI tools 
and love. Now I'm building bridges for other families who feel 
hopeless and alone.

The Bridge Project is raising $50,000 to help me work on this 
full-time. Every dollar helps me spend more time building bridges 
and less time worrying about bills.

Visit our website: [INSERT URL]

If you can't donate, please share. Every share builds the bridge wider.

Thank you for being part of this. 💙🌉

## 🎥 **VIDEO EMBEDDING (When Ready)**

When Martha's video is ready, Michael just needs to:

1. Get the embed code from Opus Clip (or YouTube)
2. Replace this line in `index.html`:

```html
<!-- FIND THIS (line 487-495): -->
<div class="video-placeholder">
    <div>
        <p>📹 Video will be embedded here</p>
        <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; opacity: 0.7; margin-top: var(--space-sm);">
            (Awaiting Opus Clip link)
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- REPLACE WITH: -->
<iframe 
    src="[EMBED LINK FROM OPUS CLIP]" 
    frameborder="0" 
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

3. Redeploy (30 seconds on Netlify/Vercel, 1 minute on GitHub Pages)
