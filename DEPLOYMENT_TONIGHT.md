## üìß EMAIL TEMPLATE FOR LAWYERS

```
Subject: URGENT: Constitutional Case - Oct 20 Deadline - NFL Visibility

Dear [Organization],

We have a time-sensitive constitutional case that could reform 
criminal justice sentencing nationwide:

CASE SUMMARY:
- Defendant: JAHmere Webb
- Situation: 12 years served, mental capacity of 15 at time of crime
- Issue: Additional 12 years vs treatment program (176% more effective)
- Court Date: October 20, 2025 (13 days)
- Judge: Honorable Judge Ferrero

CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS:
1. 8th Amendment: Is continued incarceration "cruel and unusual" 
   when treatment is available and proven more effective?
   
2. 14th Amendment: Does sentencing someone with diminished mental 
   capacity as an adult violate equal protection?

WHY THIS CASE MATTERS:
‚úÖ Sets precedent for treatment vs punishment
‚úÖ Tests constitutional limits of sentencing
‚úÖ Affects thousands of similar cases
‚úÖ NFL visibility (Tony Dungy's son is Co-Founder)
‚úÖ Community support mobilized
‚úÖ Treatment program secured with job waiting
‚úÖ $168K taxpayer savings per person

WHAT WE NEED:
- Constitutional defense brief
- Expert testimony on mental capacity
- Oral arguments to Judge Ferrero
- Pro bono or reduced fee (fundraising $50K)

VISIBILITY:
- Website: transformationagents.ai
- Co-Founder: Jordan Dungy (Tony Dungy's son)
- Support: Michael Mataluni, Tech CEO
- Community: Letters, court support organized

TIME SENSITIVE:
Court date is October 20, 2025. We need legal representation 
within 7-10 days to prepare proper constitutional defense.

Full case details: https://transformationagents.ai
Legal brief available upon request.

Can we schedule a call this week?

Respectfully,
Michael Mataluni
Co-Founder, The Bridge Project

### Jordan Dungy Social Launch:

**Instagram Post:**
```
üåâ THE BRIDGE PROJECT - CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENSE FUND

My best friend JAHmere has been in the system since we were 
kids. He had the mental capacity of a 15-year-old. 12 years 
later, he faces 12 MORE years instead of treatment.

October 20th, Judge Ferrero decides his future.

We're raising $50K for constitutional lawyers to argue that 
sentencing someone with diminished capacity as an adult 
violates the 8th and 14th Amendments.

If we win, we set precedent for THOUSANDS of families.

My dad @TonyDungy believes in JAHmere. I believe in JAHmere.
Will you help?

```
üåâ Announcing The Bridge Project - A Constitutional Defense Fund

As a tech CEO, I've spent my career building AI systems. 
Now I'm using that technology to reform criminal justice.

JAHmere Webb has been incarcerated for 12 years for a crime 
committed with the mental capacity of a 15-year-old. On 
October 20th, Judge Ferrero will decide: 12 MORE years in 
prison, or treatment that's 176% more effective.

We're raising $50,000 to fund a constitutional defense that 
could set precedent for thousands of similar cases:

8th Amendment: Is continued incarceration "cruel and unusual" 
when effective treatment is available?

14th Amendment: Does sentencing someone with diminished mental 
capacity as an adult violate equal protection?

Co-Founders:
‚Ä¢ JAHmere Webb (The Heart)
‚Ä¢ Jordan Dungy (The Voice) - Tony Dungy's son
‚Ä¢ Michael Mataluni (The Mind) - Me

One case. Constitutional precedent. Systemic reform.
