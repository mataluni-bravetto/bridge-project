## 💼 **TAX DOCUMENTATION** (Important!)

### **Keep Track For Later**:
- You're not a 501(c)(3) yet, so donations aren't tax deductible
- BUT keep records in case you become nonprofit later
- Save all donor information (with permission)
- Keep receipts/screenshots of all transactions

### **When Donors Ask About Tax Deduction**:
```
"I really appreciate you asking! Right now, The Bridge Project 
isn't a registered nonprofit, so donations aren't tax deductible 
yet. We're working toward that status, but for now, your support 
is a direct personal gift to help me build this mission. Thank 
you for understanding! 💙"
```
