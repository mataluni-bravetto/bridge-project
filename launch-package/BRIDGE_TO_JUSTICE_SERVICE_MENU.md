# BRIDGE TO JUSTICE‚Ñ¢
## AI-Powered Legal Support for Families
### Founded by Martha - A Mother Who's Been There

---

## **WHO WE ARE**

Bridge to Justice was born from a mother's desperate fight to save her son. When Martha's son Jahmere faced the criminal justice system, she felt helpless, alone, and overwhelmed. Then she learned to use AI with the help of mentor Michael Mataluni, and everything changed.

Now Martha helps other families use the same tools and strategies that helped her navigate the impossible.

**We specialize in helping families who have nowhere left to turn.**
