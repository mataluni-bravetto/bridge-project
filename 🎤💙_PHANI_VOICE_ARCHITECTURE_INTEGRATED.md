## 💻 **CODE HIGHLIGHTS**

### **Voice Recording Implementation:**
```javascript
// Initialize voice recognition
initializeVoiceRecognition() {
    const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
    this.recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
    
    this.recognition.onresult = (event) => {
        const transcript = event.results[0][0].transcript;
        // Add transcript to input automatically
        document.getElementById('abe-chat-input').value = transcript;
    };
}

// Toggle recording
toggleVoiceRecording() {
    if (this.isRecording) {
        this.recognition.stop();
    } else {
        this.recognition.start();
    }
}
```

### **Visual Feedback:**
```css
.abe-voice-btn.recording {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ff0000 0%, #ff6b6b 100%);
    animation: pulse 1.5s ease-in-out infinite;
}

@keyframes pulse {
    0%, 100% {
        box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.7);
    }
    50% {
        box-shadow: 0 0 0 10px rgba(255, 0, 0, 0);
    }
}
```

### **Context-Aware Responses:**
```javascript
// Abë understands what families need
if (lowerMessage.includes('letter')) {
    return `💙 I can help you write a powerful letter to the judge!
    
    Here's what makes a letter effective:
    1. Start with respect
    2. Tell the human story
    3. Show transformation
    4. Be specific
    5. End with hope
    
    Would you like me to help you draft this letter right now?`;
}
```
