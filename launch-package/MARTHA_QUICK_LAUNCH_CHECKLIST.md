  ðŸŒ‰ LAUNCHING: The Bridge Project

  I'm Martha, and I'm building bridges for families affected by 
  the criminal justice system. When my son Jahmere faced impossible 
  odds, I learned to use AI to fight for him. Now I'm teaching other 
  families the same tools.

  The Bridge Project is raising $50,000 to help me work on this 
  full-time. Every dollar brings us closer.

  they are, and I have tools that work.
