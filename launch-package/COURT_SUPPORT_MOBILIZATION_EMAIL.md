# COURT SUPPORT MOBILIZATION PACKAGE
## Get People to Show Up for Jahmere - October 20, 2025

---

## **EMAIL TEMPLATE #1: FOR CLOSE FRIENDS/FAMILY**

**Subject**: Can you show up for Jahmere on Oct 20th? (Court support needed)

---

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I need your help, and more importantly, **Jahmere needs you**.

**Jahmere has a court date on Monday, October 20th**, and the judge needs to see that he has a strong community supporting him. Your presence in that courtroom matters more than you might realize.

**Here's what I'm asking:**

üìç **Date**: Monday, October 20, 2025  
üïê **Time**: [COURT TIME - arrive 30 minutes early]  
üì´ **Location**: [COURTHOUSE ADDRESS]  
üíô **What to do**: Just show up, sit in the courtroom, be present

**Why your presence matters:**

Judges notice who shows up. They see when someone has community support versus when they're alone. Your presence tells the judge: "This young man matters. People believe in him. He's not alone."

You don't have to speak. You don't have to do anything except be there. But your being there speaks volumes.

**Can you come?**

Please reply YES or NO so I know who's coming. If you can't make it but want to help another way, let me know and I'll share how you can write a letter to the judge instead.

**Other ways to help:**
- Forward this email to others who know Jahmere
- Write a character reference letter (I'll send template)
- Share on social media asking for support
- Pray/send positive energy

Jahmere is a good person who's made mistakes and is working hard to transform his life. He deserves people in his corner. Can you be one of them?

With love and hope,  
[Your Name]

P.S. If you need help with transportation, childcare, or taking time off work to attend, let me know. We'll figure it out together.

## **EMAIL TEMPLATE #2: FOR COMMUNITY/CHURCH MEMBERS**

**Subject**: Community Support Needed - Court Date Oct 20th

---

Dear [Church/Community Group Name],

I'm writing to ask for your support for one of our community members, **Jahmere**, who has a critical court date coming up on **Monday, October 20th, 2025**.

**Why I'm reaching out:**

Jahmere is the son of Martha, a devoted mother who has stood by her child through unimaginable challenges. Many of you know the pain of watching someone you love struggle with the legal system. Martha and Jahmere need our community to stand with them now.

**How you can help:**

### **Option 1: Show Up in Person**
üìç **Date**: Monday, October 20, 2025  
üïê **Time**: [COURT TIME - arrive 30 minutes early]  
üì´ **Location**: [COURTHOUSE ADDRESS]

Your physical presence in the courtroom demonstrates community support and can influence the judge's decision. This is one of the most powerful ways you can help.

### **Option 2: Write a Letter to the Judge**
If you cannot attend in person, you can write a character reference letter to Judge Ferrero. Email letters to Martha at **msnisey1@yahoo.com** by **October 17th** (subject: "Character Reference for Jahmere").

I'll send a template to anyone who needs help writing the letter.

### **Option 3: Prayer Support**
For those who cannot attend or write, please hold Jahmere, Martha, and Judge Ferrero in your prayers. Pray for wisdom, mercy, and justice.

**What this means:**

This isn't just about one court date. This is about a young man's future, a mother's faith, and a community's commitment to restoration over abandonment. This is about living out our values of supporting those who are working to transform their lives.

Jahmere and his mother Martha are building **The Bridge Project** to help other families facing similar challenges. They're turning their pain into purpose. They need our support to have the chance to complete this mission.

**Will you stand with them?**

Please reply if you can attend in person or write a letter. Every person who shows up makes a difference.

In faith and community,  
[Your Name]
